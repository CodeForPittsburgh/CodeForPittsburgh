echo '<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/codeforpgh" target="_blank">@codeforpgh</a> project reads the City of Pittsburgh Police <a href="http://communitysafety.pittsburghpa.gov/Blotter.aspx" target="_blank">Blotter</a> daily report, reads the .csv file and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database. The address geo-coding is done using the Allegheny County Address <a href="http://geodata.alleghenycounty.us/arcgis/rest/services/Geocoders/EAMS_Composite_Loc/GeocodeServer" target="_blank">REST </a> service. The Council District number comes from a PostGIS lookup using the addresses lat and lng. Since this is a daily process based on yesterday\'s data, you will not see any map data from midnight until 0300 when the job runs. If an error in processing has occurred there will be a delay, you should be able to see the data before 0900. The uploading of the json files depend on successful data processing and is manually run. You can also follow City of Pittsburgh Police Incident Data from the <a href="http://www.wprdc.org/" target="_blank">Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</a> under Public Safety & Justice. </p>';
