                    <p>CodeForPittsburgh, the Pittsburgh region's Code for America Brigade makes the Pittsburgh region a better place through the use of information and technology.   Our members use projects, events, and advocacy to improve communities in a fun, collaborative atmosphere. One key role of CodeForPittsburgh involves being a relationship-builder. We foster inclusive connections between government, nonprofit, academic, for profit communities, residents, civic technologists, analysts, designers, etc. CodeForPittsburgh is a grass-roots organization inclusive of different interests and skill-sets, and we value and encourage the participation of all members regardless of their skills and background.</p>

                    <p>Projects, initiatives, and events are the primary vehicle for achieving our objectives. Weâ€™ll provide people the ability to find partners; empower and encourage them to take on projects; provide technology infrastructure; and connect people to government and other partners.These start through the initiative of CodeForPittsburgh members. There is no selection process in use at this point, but we do realize that we should have a system for approving/endorsing projects in our name.</p>
